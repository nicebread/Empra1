# Homework 1 (individually)

Please read Ch. 1 of the online book "[Experimentology](https://experimentology.io/)" and answer the following questions. You can answer in English or in German. Please write the answers directly into the answer field in Moodle. (You can of course write the answers beforehand in Word or something, and then copy the answers in here). You do not need to read any of the cited references additionally, just refer to the chapter.

- Q1: Summarize the logic of randomization.
- Q2:  Imagine that you run a survey and find that people who spend more time playing violent video games tend to be more aggressive (i.e., that there is a positive correlation between violent video games and aggression). Following Figure [1.2](https://experimentology.io/1-experiments.html#fig:experiments-money2), list three reasons why these variables may be correlated.
- Q3: Suppose you wanted to run an experiment testing whether playing violent video games causes increases in aggression. What would be your manipulation and what would be your measure? How would you deal with potential confounding by variables like age?
- Q4: Consider an experiment designed to test people’s food preferences. The experimenter randomly assigns 30 U.S. preschoolers to be served either asparagus or chicken tenders and then asks them how much they enjoyed their meal. Overall, children enjoyed the meat more; the experimenter writes a paper claiming that humans prefer meat over vegetables. List some constraints on the generalizability of this study. In light of these constraints, is this study (or some modification) worth doing at all?

<!-- Answers:

Q1: When we want to find causal relations, we want to go from “seeing” to “doing”, i.e., we want to control the situation instead of just observing it. We have to make sure, that we only manipulate a single parameter, which is also the parameter we want to observe the effect of. In order to make sure that other parameters are kept constant, we use randomization to distribute participants to groups randomly.

Q2: 
1. Playing violent could indeed cause increased aggressivity and hence be responsible for the correlation. 
2. Conversely it could be possible that people who tend to be more aggressive are more inclined to play violent video games as well. 
3. One could argue that gender confounds the correlation: Men tend to be more aggressive and to be more in playing violent video games.

Q3:
**Manipulation:** Both the control group and the experimental group play video games. Control group plays a non-violent game, while the experimental group plays a violent game.
**An idea:** Ideally, we’d try to keep other factors (like time pressure in the game / logic / the gameplay in general) constant in both groups, since those other factors might also influence aggression. We could take a “normal” game and extend it to include violent aspects. We could, for example, take Minecraft and write an extension, where players must kill villagers to stay alive. (Reduce number of spawned animals / any other food sources and make it possible for players to kill villagers and get their food. Players should also see blood when they kill a villager or an animal.) This modified version of Minecraft does not change anything in the game except introducing violence to the game.
**Measure:** Participants fill out aggression questionnaires before and after the gaming period.
**Dealing with confounders:** Randomization


Q4:
We can not generalize the results to all “people”, all vegetables and meat, because: 
- Only preschoolers from the U.S. as participants
- Enjoyment != preference (?)
- Asparagus is not the only vegetable
- There are other types of meat

From this study, we only learn that U.S. preschoolers enjoy eating chicken tenders more, compared to asparagus. It is still worth doing this study and variants of this study, we can have different groups of participants or different food each time. Over time, we would be able to generalize the effect after conducting many studies.

## Homework 2 (in groups)

 Revise interventions to target specifically intimacy *motivation* (not "affiliation", not "experienced closeness", not "behavior").
