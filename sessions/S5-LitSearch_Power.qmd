## Homework 1 (in groups)

 
- Search for articles in the existing teams (k=4 teams)
- Ideally: Find articles with **experimental** designs that **manipulate** the intimacy motivation (either up or down) within an **ESM design**.
  - Note: Such a study probably does not exist.
- If these are not available, expand the search scope. For example:
  - non-experimental studies
  - other DVs than intimacy motivation (e.g., the intimacy motive as a trait, or the experienced intimacy)
  - not ESM, but a daily diary or a lab study.
- TODO: Snowball search: Screen which papers cite the central paper TODO. If there are too many results for screening: Search again within these lists by keywords.
- Save about 8-15 articles that *roughly* fit. Please copy the bibliography of this coarse selection into the text field in the Moodle task.
- Then screen all articles: Read title + abstract
- Pick the best articles (at least 2; up to 5), and then:
  - Enter them to the [Google sheet]([Google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N-o_dUfMaQvMIIctJi4H7RM3TfF5OQZQN7IMEBA9w2o/edit?usp=sharing)) and categorize them
  - Each team should enter at least 2 papers; only new papers (nothing that has already been entered into the Google sheet by another group)
  - Extract the effect sizes (if you are able to do so - if not, make an informed guess).
