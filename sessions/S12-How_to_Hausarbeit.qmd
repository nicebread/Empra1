## Homework 1 (individually): Write reproducible manuscript in APA 7 format - Descriptive statistics

The goal of this homework is to get you started with writing your final report.
Please consult the [apaquarto documentation](https://wjschne.github.io/apaquarto/writing.html).

Add all section headings. "Methods", "Results", "Discussion" should be Level 1 (with `#`), and so on.

Write the following sections as a computable manuscript (i.e., all numbers should be computed dynamically in `R` chunks, no hard-coded numbers):

- Methods -> Participants
- Results -> Descriptive Statistics -> A descriptive table for the Pre-Questionnaire in APA format. Show the mean, standard deviation, min, max and sample size for each scale.

Use longer `R` chunks for multiline computations:

```{{r}}
# This is a longer R chunk
# The apaquarto extension automatically sets `#| echo: false` so that the code is not shown in the output

dat <- read.csv("data.csv")
# do some data preprocessing ...
```


Use inline `R` chunks to weave single numbers into continuous text:

```default
The mean age of the participants was `r round(mean(dat$age), 1)`.
```

Look at some of the APA's [sample papers](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/paper-format/sample-papers), and read the respective sections in a couple of papers from our [literature list](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N-o_dUfMaQvMIIctJi4H7RM3TfF5OQZQN7IMEBA9w2o/edit?gid=0#gid=0).

**Some notes:**

- The questionnaire scales were computed as the mean of all items.
- You do not have to report reliability statistics (you did not learn this yet).
