# Group formation

## Goal:

- Put together groups where also unacquainted people meet -> increase network size.
- Allow a certain freedom of choice, not completely random.

## Semi-randomised allocation:

- Collect all name tags
- Build 4 working islands (push tables together).
- Put 4 random name tags on the 4 tables.
- Then select the next 4 names, who choose an island to join. But only 1 person is allowed to join each island at each round.

## Round of introductions within the group (10 min)

- Task: Create of a funny name for your group.
- Give a more detailed introduction to the other group members:
  - Career goals / type of psychologist they want to become
