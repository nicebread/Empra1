## Do a power analysis in practice

Convert a between-person effect size into a within-person effect size:

See Eq. 9 from [Lakens (2013)](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/psychology/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00863/full):

```r
M_diff = 6.02 - 5.69
SD1 = 1.34
SD2 = 1.23
r = 0.5
d_rm = M_diff / sqrt(SD1^2 + SD2^2 - 2*r*SD1*SD2) * sqrt(2*(1-r))
```
