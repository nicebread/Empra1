## Homework 1 (individually): Create a codebook for the pre-questionnaire

Create the codebook for the pre-questionnaire (either in German or in English). The data file will be provided in Moodle, please document all variables. The necessary information (e.g., on the exact wording of the items) can be found in the file `variant_AA.json`. Please create a human-readable version (e.g., `xlsx`) as well as a machine-readable version (`csv` or `json`).

If you want to create a JSON file, you can also use [DataWiz2](https://datawiz2.dev.zpid.de) for this (see the instructions in the video "- [PTOS 9: Introduction to Research Data Management with D-Psy_FAIR](https://zpid.cloud.panopto.eu/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=a8a6b29f-959e-44b2-b829-af5500be5bc7)", starting at minute 29:27).
In DataWiz2, you only need the sections "2. Upload and describe datasets" and then "5. Export".
When exporting, please select "Export as JSON" and in "Include datasets" select all datasets.

Upload all versions of the codebooks to Moodle.

## Homework 2 (individually): Test the interventions in the app.
