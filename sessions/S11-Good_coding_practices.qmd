## Install software infrastructure

Follow the instructions on [this website](https://florianpargent.github.io/Quarto_LMU_OSC/preparations.html) to install the necessary software infrastructure for the course.

In short, you need to install the following software:

1. Install (or update) R: [https://cran.r-project.org/](https://cran.r-project.org/)
2. Install (or update) RStudio: [https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)
3. An installation of [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is usually not necessary, as it automatically comes with RStudio. If a warning says that Quarto is not installed, install it with the link above. 
4. Install [tinytex](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-engine.html#installing-tex), a small version of TeX that can be used to build PDF documents with Quarto:
    - In RStudio, open a Terminal window: *Tools* **>** *Terminal* **>** *New Terminal*
    - Run the following code in the Terminal:
    ``` {.bash filename="Terminal"}
    quarto install tinytex
    ```

As a final step of the preparation, let's try to render (a) an HTML document and (b) a PDF document with Quarto. For that, download [hello.qmd](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio/_hello.qmd) and open it in RStudio. Then, click on the "Render" button to render the document (or File -> Render Document).

Now, in the YAML header of the file (which is on the top of each `.qmd` file), change `format: html` to `format: pdf`, and render the document again. After some time, this should open an extra window with the PDF. You can also render to Word file with `format: docx`. All rendered files are saved in the same folder as the source `.qmd` file.



## Homework 1 (individually): Do the full Quarto tutorial

Got to our [Quarto workshop](https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-Quarto/) and do the chapters 1, 2, and 3 including all exercises. 

In addition, do section "[Exercise: APA 7 Manuscripts](https://lmu-osc.github.io/introduction-to-Quarto/apa7_manuscript.html)" from chapter 4. The document that you create here can be the starting point of your final report!
The text says "Pick a preprint of your own". You probably have none, and I would suggest that you simply create the structure of APA headings (Method, Results, Discussion, etc.) and fill it with some dummy text - or you already start writing some useful paragraphs or bullet points for our study.

You can leave out the section on bibliography for now. We will cover this together in a later session.
